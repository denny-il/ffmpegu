## 1 Synopsis

ffprobe [`options`] `input_url`

## 2 Description

ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in human- and machine-readable fashion.

For example it can be used to check the format of the container used by a multimedia stream and the format and type of each media stream contained in it.

If a url is specified in input, ffprobe will try to open and probe the url content. If the url cannot be opened or recognized as a multimedia file, a positive exit code is returned.

If no output is specified as output with `o` ffprobe will write to stdout.

ffprobe may be employed both as a standalone application or in combination with a textual filter, which may perform more sophisticated processing, e.g. statistical processing or plotting.

Options are used to list some of the formats supported by ffprobe or for specifying which information to display, and for setting how ffprobe will show it.

ffprobe output is designed to be easily parsable by a textual filter, and consists of one or more sections of a form defined by the selected writer, which is specified by the `output_format` option.

Sections may contain other nested sections, and are identified by a name (which may be shared by other sections), and an unique name. See the output of `sections`.

Metadata tags stored in the container or in the streams are recognized and printed in the corresponding "FORMAT", "STREAM", "STREAM_GROUP_STREAM" or "PROGRAM_STREAM" section.

## 3 Options

All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept a string representing a number as input, which may be followed by one of the SI unit prefixes, for example: ’K’, ’M’, or ’G’.

If ’i’ is appended to the SI unit prefix, the complete prefix will be interpreted as a unit prefix for binary multiples, which are based on powers of 1024 instead of powers of 1000. Appending ’B’ to the SI unit prefix multiplies the value by 8. This allows using, for example: ’KB’, ’MiB’, ’G’ and ’B’ as number suffixes.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing the option name with "no". For example using "-nofoo" will set the boolean option with name "foo" to false.

Options that take arguments support a special syntax where the argument given on the command line is interpreted as a path to the file from which the actual argument value is loaded. To use this feature, add a forward slash ’/’ immediately before the option name (after the leading dash). E.g.

```
ffmpeg -i INPUT -/filter:v filter.script OUTPUT
```

will load a filtergraph description from the file named `filter.script`.

### 3.1 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s) a given option belongs to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and separated from it by a colon. E.g. `-codec:a:1 ac3` contains the `a:1` stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore, it would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, so that the option is applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in `-b:a 128k` matches all audio streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams. For example, `-codec copy` or `-codec: copy` would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

*   **`stream_index`**: Matches the stream with this index. E.g. `-threads:1 4` would set the thread count for the second stream to 4. If `stream_index` is used as an additional stream specifier, then it selects stream number `stream_index` from the matching streams. Stream numbering is based on the order of the streams as detected by libavformat except when a stream group specifier or program ID is also specified. In this case it is based on the ordering of the streams in the group or program.
*   **`stream_type[:additional_stream_specifier]`**: `stream_type` is one of following: ’v’ or ’V’ for video, ’a’ for audio, ’s’ for subtitle, ’d’ for data, and ’t’ for attachments. ’v’ matches all video streams, ’V’ only matches video streams which are not attached pictures, video thumbnails or cover arts. If `additional_stream_specifier` is used, then it matches streams which both have this type and match the `additional_stream_specifier`. Otherwise, it matches all streams of the specified type.
*   **`g:group_specifier[:additional_stream_specifier]`**: Matches streams which are in the group with the specifier `group_specifier`. if `additional_stream_specifier` is used, then it matches streams which both are part of the group and match the `additional_stream_specifier`. `group_specifier` may be one of the following:
    *   **`group_index`**: Match the stream with this group index.
    *   **`#group_id` or `i:group_id`**: Match the stream with this group id.
*   **`p:program_id[:additional_stream_specifier]`**: Matches streams which are in the program with the id `program_id`. If `additional_stream_specifier` is used, then it matches streams which both are part of the program and match the `additional_stream_specifier`.
*   **`#stream_id` or `i:stream_id`**: Match the stream by stream id (e.g. PID in MPEG-TS container).
*   **`m:key[:value]`**: Matches streams with the metadata tag `key` having the specified value. If `value` is not given, matches streams that contain the given tag with any value. The colon character ’:’ in `key` or `value` needs to be backslash-escaped.
*   **`disp:dispositions[:additional_stream_specifier]`**: Matches streams with the given disposition(s). `dispositions` is a list of one or more dispositions (as printed by the `-dispositions` option) joined with ’+’.
*   **`u`**: Matches streams with usable configuration, the codec must be defined and the essential information such as video dimension or audio sample rate must be present. Note that in `ffmpeg`, matching by metadata will only work properly for input files.

### 3.2 Generic options

These options are shared amongst the ff* tools.

*   **`-L, -license`**: Show license.
*   **`-h, -?, -help, --help [arg]`**: Show help. An optional parameter may be specified to print help about a specific item. If no argument is specified, only basic (non advanced) tool options are shown. Possible values of `arg` are:
    *   **`long`**: Print advanced tool options in addition to the basic tool options.
    *   **`full`**: Print complete list of options, including shared and private options for encoders, decoders, demuxers, muxers, filters, etc.

*   **`-muxers`**: Show available muxers.
*   **`-devices`**: Show available devices.
*   **`-codecs`**: Show all codecs known to libavcodec. Note that the term ’codec’ is used throughout this documentation as a shortcut for what is more correctly called a media bitstream format.
*   **`-decoders`**: Show available decoders.
*   **`-encoders`**: Show all available encoders.
*   **`-bsfs`**: Show available bitstream filters.
*   **`-protocols`**: Show available protocols.

*   **`-layouts`**: Show channel names and standard channel layouts.
*   **`-dispositions`**: Show stream dispositions.
*   **`-colors`**: Show recognized color names.
*   **`-sources device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]`**: Show autodetected sources of the input device. Some devices may provide system-dependent source names that cannot be autodetected. The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.
    ```
    ffmpeg -sources pulse,server=192.168.0.4
    ```
*   **`-sinks device[,opt1=val1[,opt2=val2]...]`**: Show autodetected sinks of the output device. Some devices may provide system-dependent sink names that cannot be autodetected. The returned list cannot be assumed to be always complete.
    ```
    ffmpeg -sinks pulse,server=192.168.0.4
    ```
*   **`-loglevel [flags+]loglevel | -v [flags+]loglevel`**: Set logging level and flags used by the library. The optional `flags` prefix can consist of the following values:
    *   **‘repeat’**: Indicates that repeated log output should not be compressed to the first line and the "Last message repeated n times" line will be omitted.
    *   **‘level’**: Indicates that log output should add a `[level]` prefix to each message line. This can be used as an alternative to log coloring, e.g. when dumping the log to file.
    *   **‘time’**: Indicates that log lines should be prefixed with time information.
    *   **‘datetime’**: Indicates that log lines should be prefixed with date and time information.
    Flags can also be used alone by adding a ’+’/’-’ prefix to set/reset a single flag without affecting other `flags` or changing `loglevel`. When setting both `flags` and `loglevel`, a ’+’ separator is expected between the last `flags` value and before `loglevel`.
    `loglevel` is a string or a number containing one of the following values:
    *   **‘quiet, -8’**: Show nothing at all; be silent.
    *   **‘panic, 0’**: Only show fatal errors which could lead the process to crash, such as an assertion failure.
    *   **‘fatal, 8’**: Only show fatal errors. These are errors after which the process absolutely cannot continue.
    *   **‘error, 16’**: Show all errors, including ones which can be recovered from.
    *   **‘warning, 24’**: Show all warnings and errors. Any message related to possibly incorrect or unexpected events will be shown.
    *   **‘info, 32’**: Show informative messages during processing. This is the default value.
    *   **‘verbose, 40’**: Same as `info`, except more verbose.
    *   **‘debug, 48’**: Show everything, including debugging information.
    *   **‘trace, 56’**
    Example: `ffmpeg -loglevel repeat+level+verbose -i input output`
*   **`-report`**: Dump full command line and log output to a file named `program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log` in the current directory. Setting the environment variable `FFREPORT` to any value has the same effect. The following options are recognized:
    *   **`file`**: set the file name to use for the report; `%p` is expanded to the name of the program, `%t` is expanded to a timestamp, `%%` is expanded to a plain `%`
    *   **`level`**: set the log verbosity level using a numerical value.
*   **`-hide_banner`**: Suppress printing banner.
*   **`-cpuflags flags (global)`**: Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for testing.
*   **`-cpucount count (global)`**: Override detection of CPU count.
*   **`-max_alloc bytes`**: Set the maximum size limit for allocating a block on the heap. Default is INT_MAX.

### 3.3 AVOptions

These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the `-help` option. They are separated into two categories:

*   **`generic`**: These options can be set for any container, codec or device.
*   **`private`**: These options are specific to the given container, device or codec.

Example: `ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3`

All codec AVOptions are per-stream, and thus a stream specifier should be attached to them:
`ffmpeg -i multichannel.mxf -map 0:v:0 -map 0:a:0 -map 0:a:0 -c:a:0 ac3 -b:a:0 640k -ac:a:1 2 -c:a:1 aac -b:2 128k out.mp4`

Note: the `-nooption` syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use `-option 0`/`-option 1`.
